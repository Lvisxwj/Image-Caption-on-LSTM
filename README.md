# The Halloween Haunting

She used to wake up screaming about it. My ex. Third year, just like me. Before the end, she'd have the same nightmare on repeat—me, walking away with some fresh-faced first-year. Someone new. Someone unburdened. Someone who didn't know yet how to break a heart.

*Prophetic dreams are funny that way. You dismiss them as paranoia, hold someone tighter, swear it'll never happen. Then ten months later you're living proof that some nightmares come true.*

The new girl was a freshman. Exactly like the dream. Beautiful in that dangerous way—the kind that makes you forget you're still bleeding from the last time.

And she liked me back.

*The universe is a sadist with perfect timing.*

Hangzhou Paradise on Halloween. Appropriate. Nothing says "moving on" like a theme park.

We rode the thrill rides. Two of them. Screamed together like people do when they're pretending fear is fun. She grabbed my hand during the drops—that instinctive reach for safety that feels like trust but might just be reflex.

On stage, dancers performed "Smooth Criminal" and "Thriller." Michael Jackson knew something about monsters. About things that won't stay dead. About dancing with danger while pretending it's entertainment.

*Everything was perfect. Textbook perfect. New-relationship perfect. The kind of perfect that makes you suspicious because you know how stories like this end.*

But with every laugh, every touch, every moment that should have felt like victory, the missing got heavier.

**THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS**

Three days until her birthday. My ex's birthday. The number sat in my head like a bullet in a chamber, waiting.

The new girl didn't know. Didn't know she was dating a man with one foot still in someone else's grave. Didn't know that every time she smiled, I was doing the math—comparing, contrasting, measuring her against a ghost.

*That's the thing about moving on. You can meet someone new, someone perfect, someone who checks every box. But you're still the same broken bastard, just with a fresh audience for your dysfunction.*

The dreams started coming back. Not about the new girl—about my ex. But different now. Changed. Not the person I remembered, not the person we were together. In the dreams, she'd evolved past me. Moved on. Become someone I didn't recognize.

*And that was the real nightmare. Not losing her. But the realization that she'd lost me first, months ago, and I was just now getting the memo.*

The closer the birthday got, the heavier everything became. The new girl would text and I'd stare at the screen, trying to remember why I was doing this. Trying to convince myself it wasn't just fulfilling my ex's worst fear to prove some point to no one.

*Spite is a poor foundation for love. But sometimes it's all you've got.*

Halloween decorations everywhere. Fake tombstones. Plastic skeletons. Cheap approximations of death. But the real haunting was quieter—just a date on a calendar, getting closer, turning every moment with this new girl into a countdown to something that had nothing to do with her.

She deserved better. Deserved someone who wasn't using her as proof that prophecies come true. Deserved someone who could be present instead of drowning in the past.

## *The past is a loaded gun. You can try to unload it, hide it in a drawer, pretend it's not there. But sooner or later, you're going to put it in your mouth.*
